        <h2>Doggy Post #1-- Great Activities You Can Enjoy With Your Dog</h2>
        
        <p>Here is an introduction to some great things people can do with their dogs. Most activities welcome all dogs, whether purebred or of mixed breed heritage. Some of these activities are classed as <strong>"working dog"</strong> activities, but are also done on a recreational basis, or as a public service. Some dog activities are purely recreational in nature, while others are competitive dog sports. Many of these activities may be new to you. I have chosen my links based upon how welcoming they are to the merely curious.</p>

        <h3>"People who play with their dog, stay with their dog!"</h3>

       <h3>Why do dog activities matter? Why promote them? Dog activities matter because they help dogs keep their homes.</h3> 

        <p>When people and dogs do things together it is good news all around. Many of these activities provide the structure that helps people learn to better communicate with their dogs. The dogs have a better opportunity to learn good manners. That makes them easier to live with and less likely to be given up. The activities help people get in touch with one another to share information. That also helps people to learn about dogs, to avoid problems, and to solve them in a healthy way. The activities provide exercise in a fun way that boosts the relationship. The exercise, in turn, reduces boredom. A dog that exercises with its human is less likely to have behavior problems. A wonderful side benefit is that these activities can be a mental boost for humans and dogs alike.</p>
